# English learning APP
This is the backend service of an English learning APP.
## Features
- ### Vocabulary learning
     We use memory curve to help users learn new words. 
Mostly existing APPs such as "sanbey" only support the learning of words that from word book.
But we also support user to add new words to the word book. 
We also support the learning of words from the articles.
Then we use the memory curve to help users learn the words.
- ### Listening practice
     We use the articles to help users practice their listening ability.
Users can also add new articles to our system, 
and then we will automatically generate the listening practice.
- ### Speaking practice
     The most exciting part of our APP is the speaking practice.
We use the newest artificial intelligence technology to help users practice their speaking ability.
With the advantage of the chatGPT, it is possible for users to practice their speaking ability at a low cost.
- ### Reading practice
     We use the articles or a book to help users practice their reading ability.
The best way to improve your reading ability is to read more.
If you find the book you want to read isn't in our system, you can add it to our system, or ask us to add it.
